Galina Starovoitova was a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament.
 She tried to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down.
 She had said she would run again in 2000.
 There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
 Petersburg recently.
 The least Yeltsin can do is to hunt down her killers and bring them to trial.
 She was shot three times in the head, collapsed and died instantly.
 Her aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded.
