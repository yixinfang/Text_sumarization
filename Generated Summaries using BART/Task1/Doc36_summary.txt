Nobel Literature laureate to be announced Thursday by Swedish Academy.
 A writer's nationality, by the terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed to be irrelevant.
 China, which translates and publishes the works of many Nobel winners, wants its first laureate.
 Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award.
 He is also the fourth successive European to win the prize.
 The 75-year-old joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess.
