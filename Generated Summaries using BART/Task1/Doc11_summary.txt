Local newspapers splashed close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruised face for two days.
 Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim.

 Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept.
 20 under the Internal Security Act.
 He has been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
 He is facing trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system.
