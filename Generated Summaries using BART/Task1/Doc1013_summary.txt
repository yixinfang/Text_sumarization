Three times since 1994, a sniper has used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion.
 U.S.
 and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York.
 Dr.
 Barnett Slepian was killed Oct.
 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home.
 He is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings at abortion clinics.
