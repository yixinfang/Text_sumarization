Dissidents Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, Qin Yongming sentenced to long jail terms.
 State Department says the men were involved in efforts to form a new political party.

 Chinese leaders have been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout 1990s.
 He is accused of subverting state power, a crime punishable by 10 years to life.
