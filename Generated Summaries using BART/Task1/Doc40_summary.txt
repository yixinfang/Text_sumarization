Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday.
 The delay is the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday morning when a plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials becomes the first arrival.
 At half-hour intervals, six more planes are to come in from places such as Morocco and Spain.
 The airport's opening last month was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward statehood.
 Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence.
