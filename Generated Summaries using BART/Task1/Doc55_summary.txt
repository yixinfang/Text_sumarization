Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support.
 The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate.

 Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policies of its old one.
 Politicians say Prodi is now four votes short of the 316 votes needed for a majority.
