U.S.
 special envoy Richard Holbrooke says military situation in Kosovo is as bad now as two weeks ago.
 He will explain the ''extreme gravity of the situation'' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday.
 Milosesi also told he must insure that 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting be allowed to return home.
 U.S., Russia warn NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless action is taken soon.
