Fidel Castro says he disagrees with the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
 Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.
 The judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule.
 British lawyers argue that arrest order sent from Spain is illegal because general is not a Spanish citizen.
 Spain wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.
